# to-do-list
This is a simple To-Do  built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add, complete, and filter tasks based on their status.

# How to Use
Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the to-do list.
Once a task is completed, you can check the checkbox next to the task name to mark it as completed. It will be shown with a strikethrough style.
You can filter the tasks using the "All," "Pending," and "Completed" buttons. Clicking on each button will show the corresponding tasks while hiding the others.
